After examination and taking my professional interests into account, graphics and web developement, I decided to work with the web-server library. I thought that it would be interesting to learn how to build a web page with Racket.</p><p>I started by reading the documentation to become familiar with how the library worked. I investigated how an html page was created, how attributes were added to elements.</p><p>Once I knew how to modify the elements I then gave myself the task of creating a header bar with a menu system. The menu would have links to both the current page and an external source; I used the Github project fork page as an external link.</p><p>Once I had the structural elements working, I then decided to modify the styling of the page. I completed the header using the racket logo from an external resource and titled the page.</p><p>Since I am investigating how to make webpages with Racket I decided to continue writing the report with Racket. I figured it would be a good way of discovering how making a webpage was like and seeing the differences from other server languages I have used in the past.</p><p>I found that the documentation and resoources for constructing webpages is lacking for racket since there are other more popular server options out there, but they exist. I had a lot of trouble following how to include external static files using what was in the documentation as the example was incomplete. Following the example given in the article found at <a href="http://www.greghendershott.com/2013/03/serve-static-files.html">www.greghendershott.com</a>, I was able to figure it out.</p></div></body></html>
