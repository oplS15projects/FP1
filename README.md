# Final Project Assignment 1: Exploration (FP1) 
DUE March 25, 2015 Wednesday (2015-03-25)

Full assignment specfication is [on Piazza.][piazza]

Write your report right in this file. Instructions are below. You can delete them if you like, or just leave them at the bottom.
You are allowed to change/delete anything in this file to make it into your report. It will be public, FYI.

This file is formatted with the [**markdown** language][markdown], so take a glance at how that works.

This file IS your report for the assignment, including code and your story.

Code is super easy in markdown, which you can easily do inline `(require net/url)` or do in whole blocks:
```
#lang racket

(require net/url)

(define myurl (string->url "http://www.cs.uml.edu/"))
(define myport (get-pure-port myurl))
(display-pure-port myport)
```
I went through couple of libraries to see what options I might have for the project. 

### My Library: Slideshow, pict/flash,  pict/balloon, require pict/face, web-server/insta
* a narrative of what you did:
<br />I went through the documentation and modified the codes given in the documentation, created some fun shapes in different colors. Using  libraries and functions defined in the libraries, I tried creating shapes like circles and colors both filled in with color and empty forms. I tried appending the shapes both vertically and horizontally created attached images. Also, I tried creating simple web applications using web-server/insta.


* the code that you wrote

                         "Hey, this is my first post!")))
```

The narrative itself should be no longer than 350 words. Yes, you can add more files and link or refer to them. This is github, handling files is awesome and easy!

Ask questions publicly in the Piazza group.
