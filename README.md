### My Library: racket/GUI

I decided for the first exploration assignment to look at how a GUI can be created in racket. I decide to use the basic GUI library to complete this task. The fist order of buisness was to see how to create a frame/window, because with out this there is no GUI. To create a basic frame I used the code below.

####Basic Frame Code:

```

The output of this code was just a simple frame/window that can be seen below.
