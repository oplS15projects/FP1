# Final Project Assignment 1: Exploration (FP1) 
DUE March 25, 2015 Wednesday (2015-03-25)

### Program Code:
```
#lang racket
#lang racket/gui
(require racket/gui/base)

(define vis_frame (new frame% [label "Data Visualization Tool"]))
(define edit_frame (new frame% [label "Data Editor"] [width 300] [height 300]))

(define mb (new menu-bar% [parent vis_frame]))

(define m_file (new menu% [label "File"] [parent mb]))
(define m_help (new menu% [label "Help"] [parent mb]))

(new menu-item%
       [parent m_help]
       [label "About"]
       [callback (lambda (b e) (message-box "About" "This is an exploration!" vis_frame))])

(new menu-item%
       [parent m_help]
       [label "Contact"]
       [callback (lambda (b e) (message-box "Contact" "Contact Info: John Smith" vis_frame))])

(new menu-item%
       [parent m_file]
       [label "Load"]
       [callback (lambda (b e)  (send edit_frame show #t))])

(new menu-item%
       [parent m_file]
       [label "Save"]
       [callback (lambda (b e)  (send edit_frame show #f))])

(new menu-item%
       [parent m_file]
       [label "Exit"]
       [callback (lambda (b e)  (send vis_frame show #f))])

(new separator-menu-item% [parent m_file])

(define panel (new horizontal-panel% [parent vis_frame] [alignment '(center center)]))

(new button% [parent panel]
             [label "Load File"]
             [callback (lambda (button event)
                         (send edit_frame show #t))])

(new button% [parent panel]
             [label "Save File"]
             [callback (lambda (button event)
                         (send edit_frame show #f))])

(new button% [parent panel]
             [label "Exit"]
             [callback (lambda (button event)
                         (send vis_frame show #f))])

(define msg (new message% [parent vis_frame]
                          [label "Open a .rkt file containing a single list named lst"]))

(define edit_msg (new message% [parent edit_frame]
                          [label "This is the data editing window"]))

(send mb enable #t)
(send vis_frame show #t)
```

### My Library: Racket GUI Toolkit
### Narrative:
The code I wrote creates a two frame program. The first frame is a simple loader with both a menu bar and a menu panel filled with buttons. This frame would be used to load a file containing data to be visualized and a way to save it when the user is done editing. The second frame is the actual viewer and editor where a data structure would be represented graphically. A user would be able to modify the data structure and its contents in this window and then save the changes which would generate a new list in Racket. 

My intent with this setup is to build a tool to display lists and trees graphically and provide editing capabilities. I could later add in template support for predefined data structures that users could edit and build off of. One example that came to mind is a car template to keep track of common maintenance responsibilities, part numbers, dates and mileages that the jobs were last performed, etc. The user would edit some of this and the structure would populate certain sub-lists such as the next ten maintenance jobs to be performed. This is just a possible, general direction though.
