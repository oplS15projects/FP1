# Final Project Assignment 1: Exploration (FP1) 
DUE March 25, 2015 Wednesday (2015-03-25)

Full assignment specfication is [on Piazza.][piazza]

Write your report right in this file. Instructions are below. You can delete them if you like, or just leave them at the bottom.
You are allowed to change/delete anything in this file to make it into your report. It will be public, FYI.

This file is formatted with the [**markdown** language][markdown], so take a glance at how that works.

This file IS your report for the assignment, including code and your story.

Code is super easy in markdown, which you can easily do inline `(require net/url)` or do in whole blocks:
```
#lang racket

(require net/url)

(define myurl (string->url "http://www.cs.uml.edu/"))
(define myport (get-pure-port myurl))
(display-pure-port myport)
```

### My Library: (library name here)
Write what you did!
Remember that this report must include:
 
* a narrative of what you did
* the code that you wrote
* output from your code demonstrating what it produced
* any diagrams or figures explaining your work 
 
The narrative itself should be no longer than 350 words. Yes, you can add more files and link or refer to them. This is github, handling files is awesome and easy!

Ask questions publicly in the Piazza group.

### How to Do and Submit this assignment

1. To start, [**fork** this repository][forking].
1. You might want to [**Clone**][ref-clone] this repository to your computer
  2. (This assignment is just one README.md file, so you can edit it right in github without cloning if you like)
1. Modify the README.md file and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your solution.
1. [**Push**][ref-push]/sync the changes up to your GitHub (skip this if you didn't clone)
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository to turn in the assignment.

######: write up:
I started this assignment by browsing the link provided on piazza for racket documentation. I was interested with many libraries. I dipped my feet into plot, which was a 3d modeling library but chose to use racket/gui for this assignment.
I started off by reading some of the code provided on the documentation website to get accustomed to creating a frame. I then tried to do some things on my own. I managed to create a button named credits, that on a click event, will launch a pop-up that simply holds some text that gives credit to me. I also played around with the sizing of the GUI. After I did this I continued to read the website for documentation on how to use this library with exit buttons, stored event procedures  and how to change cosmetics of the GUI. I noticed that the functions are well thought and are standard from most GUI libraries, but this library allows for popup frames more conveniently. This has always been a problem for me when trying to create pop-ups using a different language, but maybe the recursive element of racket solves this issue. The set-background color did not work for me in the context the documentation provided, but that was the only trouble I had with this library.
