# Final Project Assignment 1: Exploration (FP1)

Student: Kevin Wacome

### My Libraries: [The Racket Graphical Interface Toolkit](http://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/), [RSound: A Sound Engine for Racket](http://pkg-build.racket-lang.org/doc/rsound/index.html), [Portaudio: Bindings for the Portaudio portable sound library](http://pkg-build.racket-lang.org/doc/portaudio/index.html), [Safe Homogenous Vectors](http://docs.racket-lang.org/foreign/homogeneous-vectors.html)

I like music and I play guitar, poorly, as a hobby. I would like my final project to involve the manipulation of sound. The ffi/vector, rsound and portaudio racket libraries contain the necessary procedures and data types to generate sound. I am not very well versed in how sound is represented digitally. I just copied the racket documentation for generating a basic sine wave and extended the code. I intend to research this later so I have a better understanding of the inner workings.

I made some of my own modifications to the documentation code to allow for a user to manipulate the sine wave generated by using the racket/gui library. Delving into the gui library would be beneficial to any project regardless of the topic. I created a window that allows the user to press a button to generate a single tone. I also added a volume slider to the window so the user can adjust the volume of the tone generated. As the user adjusts the volume slider the the amplitude of the sine wave is either reduced or increased thereby lowering or increasing the volume of the tone played. I also added a save feature. The user specificies a file path and the tone, with its selected volume, will be saved to a file. I am not sure what the format of the audio file is.
