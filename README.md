# Final Project Assignment 1: Exploration (FP1) 
DUE March 25, 2015 Wednesday (2015-03-25)

Full assignment specfication is [on Piazza.][piazza]

I used the xml library. I first played around with opening xml documents and writting xml to the screen. My code below takes an xml style string and prints it to the screen in xml format.

```
#lang racket
(require xml)
 
(define xml-str "<?xml version=1.0 ?>
       <root>
           <title>Absolutely (Story of a Girl)</title>
           <length>189333</length>
       </root>")
 

(define xml (read-xml/document (open-input-string xml-str)))
(write-xml xml)
```

Output: 

<?xml version=1.0 ?>
<root>
           <title>Absolutely (Story of a Girl)</title>
           <length>189333</length>
       </root>




Write your report right in this file. Instructions are below. You can delete them if you like, or just leave them at the bottom.
You are allowed to change/delete anything in this file to make it into your report. It will be public, FYI.

This file is formatted with the [**markdown** language][markdown], so take a glance at how that works.

This file IS your report for the assignment, including code and your story.

Code is super easy in markdown, which you can easily do inline `(require net/url)` or do in whole blocks:
```
#lang racket

(require net/url)

(define myurl (string->url "http://www.cs.uml.edu/"))
(define myport (get-pure-port myurl))
(display-pure-port myport)
```

### My Library: (library name here)
Write what you did!
Remember that this report must include:
 
* a narrative of what you did
* the code that you wrote
* output from your code demonstrating what it produced
* any diagrams or figures explaining your work 
 
The narrative itself should be no longer than 350 words. Yes, you can add more files and link or refer to them. This is github, handling files is awesome and easy!

Ask questions publicly in the Piazza group.
