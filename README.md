# Final Project Assignment 1: Exploration (FP1) 
DUE March 25, 2015 Wednesday (2015-03-25)

### My Library: Browser
For this assignment I decided to look into the browser package for DrRacket since I enjoy soing web programming and thought
that this would be something to play around in. I read up on the documentation on the browser and decided to see how easy
it would be to just open up a random website and view it. As it turns out, it is very easy, you just type in a command like so:

`(open-url "your url")`

That opened up the page, but it looks scrambled and not at all like the regular site. Later on I may decide to see what it
would take to get the browser package to open up websites normally.

Next I read more of the documentation for commands that were easy to understand and that didn't require me to write a 
new html file to interact with. I found the `html-img-ok` command that takes in a boolean to see whether the browser should render images or just ignore.

I decided to end my little voyage into the browser plugin by defining some shortcuts to a few sites and made a function that will toggle the appearance of images.
