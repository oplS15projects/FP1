# Final Project Assignment 1: Exploration (FP1) 
DUE March 25, 2015 Wednesday (2015-03-25)

### My Library: math/number theory

As the data sent from user through JSON, this code takes as (input) list and checks which procedure to apply. For now I have exponent, factorial, logarithms to implement. The actual functions takes arguments but i made the code to just select a procedure so that we can manipulate more than 2 or any other number of arguments/variables that the user entered. I thought it was very hard but it was not, should have done it earlier. I am sorry :P
