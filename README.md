```
#lang racket

(require plot)

(plot3d (surface3d (Î» (x y) (* (cos (* x x)) (sin y)))
                     (- pi) pi (- pi) pi)
          #:title "Final Project Part 1 - Rohit Krishnan"
          #:x-label "x" #:y-label "y" #:z-label "cos(x) sin(y)")
```

### Plot Library

Using the plot library is super easy! I started by going to the [Racket Plot Documentation] and
I was able to draw this 3D shape which rendered a graph of an equation which is hard coded in the 
racket code.
