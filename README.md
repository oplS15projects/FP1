### My Library: (SMTP: sending E-mail)
In Racket Documentation I have selected smtp sending E-mail library and I go through all the stuff gave in the library and it is quite similar way of sending an E-mail but we have to use some commands to implement in racket environment below are the commands

(require net/smtp):The net/smtp module provides tools for sending electronic mail messages using SMTP. 
we have to give (smtp-send-message	) to send message 

(server-address :) this Connects to the server at server-address and port-no to send a message. this will include from: which tell us where the mail came from and To: tells us where to send mail.

header: The header argument is the complete message header. A header is represented as a string or byte string containing CRLF-delimited lines. In addition, the header ends with two CRLFs 

message: The message argument is the body of the message, where each string or byte string in the list corresponds to a single line of message text.

port no:The  port-no argumentâ€”which can be specified either with the #:port-no keyword.

username : is the keyword used to add a username.
password: is used to give a password

tcp-connect: is used to connect as a client to a listing server.

 
the output I got like I got a new window opened and i got some errors like should enter auth-user, auth-password and after I cleared the errors  it gave me username and password to enter   
 
The narrative itself should be no longer than 350 words. Yes, you can add more files and link or refer to them. This is github, handling files is awesome and easy!
